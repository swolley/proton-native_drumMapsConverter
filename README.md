# proton-native_drumMapsConverter

### Midi percussion tracks converter between drum maps.

<p>
Actually it has biultin maps but in future it'll be able to add new maps and customize them.<br />
The map format actually used is the Cubase's xml export format.<br />
It uses 'proton-native' framework, 'xml2js' library to parse xml files and 'midiconverter' library to parse and modify midi files.
